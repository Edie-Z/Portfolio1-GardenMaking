# Garden-Making: UI/UX Design Showcase

## Project Overview

**Garden-Making** is a design showcase for an AR-enabled gardening app inspired by traditional Chinese gardens. This webpage highlights the design journey of the project, created in **2021**, including research, conceptualization, and interface design. The app aims to blend online and offline experiences, promoting garden aesthetics and encouraging engagement with physical garden sites.

This webpage features smooth scrolling navigation, dynamic background transitions, and a full-screen display of the project's visual assets.

## Design Process

1. **Research**:
   - Studied the characteristics of traditional Chinese garden design, including spatial layout, natural elements, and cultural essence.
   - Analyzed user needs and potential solutions for combining AR with gardening experiences.

2. **Mind Mapping**:
   - Developed a comprehensive framework outlining user goals and app features.

3. **Wireframing**:
   - Created low-fidelity prototypes to plan the app's interface and interaction design.

4. **Interface Design**:
   - Used **Adobe Illustrator** to design detailed, user-friendly UI layouts.

5. **3D Modeling and Rendering**:
   - Created 3D models of garden elements using **SketchUp**.
   - Rendered high-quality visualizations with **Enscape**.
